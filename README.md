# Hyper

New mathematics and new physics to understand and implement true intelligence!!!

In this repository, the Hyper class implements a novel numeric coding mechanism, a new type of hypercomplex numeric object with new algebraic rules. It is essentially a tensor but can logically also be a matrix, a vector or a scalar, any of these things in the same object, it can even be a constant or a variable controlled by a modulating function and triggering events, with an arbitrary number of decimals, precision and exponent among other benefits.

On the other hand, the HyperCalc class implements a kind of calculator with many of the operations that define the algebra of this new generalized numeric type. The idea is that Hyper objects have the least possible interface and data and functions to replicate, that they only serve as containers for the elements that make up the number, and the process and operations are carried out by other objects such as HyperCalc with which these numbers are built, operated, transformed and rendered to a certain format.

 HyperCalc should evolve into a kind of specialized processor emulator, part sequential, part parallel, part tensor, or otherwise, always seeking to improve the efficiency of these types of processes, using the properties with which the algebra of the new numbers will be built, without forgetting that the real priority when finding new mathematics, rather than improving the efficiency of intelligent computing, is to find physical meaning in artificial intelligence and to be able to understand it, to find logical patterns that allow us to replicate it in the best way. 

The rest of the files in the repository are classes of related operations and test functions demonstrating these concepts and operations.
